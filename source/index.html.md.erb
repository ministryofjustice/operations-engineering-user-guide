# Operations Engineering

## Introduction

The Operations Engineering team focuses on purchasing, constructing, and maintaining a variety of tools that aid in the development and management of software on a large scale.

Although our primary platform for development and hosting is the [Cloud Platform](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/), the tools and standards we develop will be accessible and applicable across a variety of platforms and hosting environments throughout the organisation.

Please note that there are certain services that we do not offer. For details on these services, kindly refer to [this documentation](documentation/information/we-dont-do-that.html).
