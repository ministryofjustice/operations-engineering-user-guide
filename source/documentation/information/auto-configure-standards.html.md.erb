# Automatically configure GitHub Repository Standards

There is a set of
[standards](https://user-guide.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/information/mojrepostandards.html)
that is a recommended baseline of best practices for GitHub repositories.

## What does the automation do?

The automation runs periodically looking for the "standards-compliant" topic on a repository.

If the repository contains this topic, the automation will apply the following configuration:

### Apply Branch Protection on _"main"_

> Your default branch should be configured to _"main"_ as per
our [Inclusive Language Guidance](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/using-inclusive-language.html#using-inclusive-language)

- Enforce admins
- Set required review count to 1 _*This will be set even if the current review count is greater than 1_
- Dismiss stale reviews

The automation will also maintain any `required checks` that may have been pre-configured manually.

### Apply Repository Standards

- Enable Issues

### Standards the automation does not currently configure:

- Description set
- License

## How do I use the automation?

To enable the automation for a given GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Repository page
2. Click the Cog on the top right of the page
3. Add a new topic called "standards-compliant"
4. Save the changes

## How do I turn off the automation?

To disable the automation for a given GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Repository page
2. Click the Cog on the top right of the page
3. Remove the "standards-compliant" topic
4. Save the changes

## When does the automation run?

Currently, the automation runs at 6 am every day and can be run
manually [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering/actions/workflows/job-apply-standards.yml)
