# GitHub

## Enterprise Account

The Operations Engineering team manages
the [Ministry of Justice GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprises/ministry-of-justice-uk). We maintain and
support our enterprise instance, which includes several organisations:

- [Ministry of Justice](https://github.com/ministryofjustice)
- [MoJ Analytical Services](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services)
- [ministryofjustice-test](https://github.com/ministryofjustice-test)
- [Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority](https://github.com/CriminalInjuriesCompensationAuthority) *
  *_though it sits within the Enterprise Account, this organisation is not managed by Operations Engineering_*

### Actions Quota for Private and Internal Repositories

> The Ministry of Justices' GitHub Enterprise account reserves the following usage quotas for GitHub Actions (per
month):
>
> - **50,000** Minutes
> - **50GB** Storage

The quota renews at the start of each month and is a shared quota across all private and internal repositories in
MoJs GitHub Enterprise account.

Teams are responsible for actively managing their usage of actions for private and internal repositories. Reaching these
limits means that the service will be unavailable for private and internal repositories until the next reset.

_**These limits do not apply to public repositories.**_

If you are considering making your repository public, consider reading the technical guidance
on [converting private or internal repositories to public](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/storing-source-code.html#private-repositories)
and
our [Dos and Don't Guide for Public Repositories](https://user-guide.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/information/storing-code-in-public.html).

## Access Management

Operations Engineering is responsible for granting access to both the Ministry of Justice and the MoJ Analytical
Services Organisations.

### Single Sign On (SSO) for Ministry of Justice or MoJ Analytical Services GitHub Organisations

If you have a `@digital.justice.gov.uk` or `@justice.gov.uk` email address and require access to the Ministry of Justice Organisation or the MoJ Analytical Services Organisation, you can use GitHub SSO to join the Organisation.
[Click here](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/sso) to join the Ministry of Justice Organisation. [Click here](https://github.com/orgs/moj-analytical-services/sso) to join the MoJ Analytical Services Organisation.

If you do not have a GitHub account, you will be prompted to create one at the end of the SSO process; you should add your work email as
your [primary email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/changing-your-primary-email-address)
address in GitHub.

If you have a problem with the SSO process, you can contact us via our Slack
channel [#ask-operations-engineering](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01BUKJSZD4) or email us
at [Operations Engineering](mailto:operations-engineering@digital.justice.gov.uk).

### Third-Party Supplier Management

If you are a Third-Party Supplier who is maintaining code on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, you will need to be
added as
an [Outside Collaborator](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/storing-source-code.html#outside-collaborator).

Outside Collaborators will only be able to gain access to specific repositories.

### Access to repositories

When a user joins one of our Github Organisations as a member they are added to the `all-org-members` or `everyone` Team, in the case of the Ministry of Justice or MoJ Analytical Services Organisation respectively. Addition to these teams enables access to a number of MoJ shared tools and platforms.

To enable users to make changes to code and work with a repository, they must be added to the repository with the appropriate permissions, either with direct access or via a Github Team. In accordance with the [Technical Standards](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/storing-source-code.html#github):

> Delivery teams are responsible for setting correct permissions on their repos. This includes ensuring the right users have access and removing privileges when they leave the team. It’s often helpful to manage permissions across all of a delivery team’s GitHub repositories in one place, by setting up a GitHub team for the people on a delivery team, and giving that GitHub team read/write privileges for the repos.

If you require access to a repository, or a change in permissions on a repository, please contact the Team Maintainer or Admin for that repository.

Only where a team lacks a maintainer or there is no administrator on a repository will Operations Engineering step in to manage repository-level access. As part of that intervention, we ensure that a suitable maintainer/administrator is assigned for future permission management.

If you require access/need to give access to an Outside Collaborator, raise an issue or pull request in the relevant
repository for the organisation below:

- Ministry of
  Justice = [ministryofjustice/github-collaborators](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-collaborators)
- MoJ Analytical
  Services = [moj-analytical-services/github-outside-collaborators](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/github-outside-collaborators)

- **Repository Templates Management:** We provide and manage templates for repositories, promoting best practices and
  consistency across projects.
