# GitHub

## Enterprise Account

The Operations Engineering team manages
the [Ministry of Justice GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprises/ministry-of-justice-uk). We maintain and
support our enterprise instance, which includes several organisations:

- [Ministry of Justice](https://github.com/ministryofjustice)
- [MoJ Analytical Services](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services)
- [Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority](https://github.com/CriminalInjuriesCompensationAuthority) *
  *_though it sits within the Enterprise Account, this organisation is not managed by Operations Engineering_*

### Actions Quota for Private and Internal Repositories

> The Ministry of Justices' GitHub Enterprise account reserves the following usage quotas for GitHub Actions (per
month):
>
> - **50,000** Minutes
> - **50GB** Storage

The quota renews at the start of each month and is a shared quota across all private and internal repositories in
MoJs GitHub Enterprise account.

Teams are responsible for actively managing their usage of actions for private and internal repositories. Reaching these
limits means that the service will be unavailable for private and internal repositories until the next reset.

_**These limits do not apply to public repositories.**_

If you are considering making your repository public, consider reading the technical guidance
on [converting private or internal repositories to public](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/storing-source-code.html#private-repositories)
and
our [Dos and Don't Guide for Public Repositories](https://user-guide.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/information/storing-code-in-public.html).

## Access Management

### Joining Ministry of Justice/MoJ Analytical Services Organisation

Operations Engineering is responsible for granting access to both the Ministry of Justice and the MoJ Analytical
Services Organisations.

If you require access to these organisations, you can contact us via our Slack
channel [#ask-operations-engineering](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01BUKJSZD4) or email us
at [Operations Engineering](mailto:operations-engineering@digital.justice.gov.uk).

> You must provide an email address that we can send the invitation to. We only allow access to the following
pre-approved email addresses:
>
> - @cica.gov.uk
> - @digital.justice.gov.uk
> - @ima-citizensrights.org.uk
> - @judicialappointments.gov.uk
> - @judiciary.uk
> - @justice.gov.uk
> - @ppo.gov.uk
> - @publicguardian.gov.uk
> - @sentencingcouncil.gov.uk

If you do not have a GitHub account, the invitation you receive will prompt you to create one before joining the
organisation.

If you already have a GitHub account and wish to use it for work, you should add your work email as
your [primary email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/changing-your-primary-email-address)
address in GitHub.

#### Single Sign On (SSO) for Ministry of Justice Organisation

If you have a `@digital.justice.gov.uk` and only require access to the Ministry of Justice Organisation, you can use
[SSO](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/sso) to gain access via your Google Workspace account.

#### Third-Party Supplier Management

If you are a Third-Party Supplier who is maintaining code on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, you will need to be
added as
an [Outside Collaborator](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/storing-source-code.html#outside-collaborator).

Outside Collaborators will only be able to gain access to specific repositories.

If you require access/need to give access to an Outside Collaborator, raise an issue or pull request in the relevant
repository for the organisation below:

- Ministry of
  Justice = [ministryofjustice/github-collaborators](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-collaborators)
- MoJ Analytical
  Services = [moj-analytical-services/github-outside-collaborators](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/github-outside-collaborators)

### Third-Party Application and Integration Approval
We review and approve requests to integrate third-party apps, keeping our tech ecosystem secure and efficient.

### Fine-Grained Personal Access Token Requests

We oversee the approval of such requests, ensuring secure and proper usage of GitHub.

## Safety Nets

### Team Management

Where teams lack a maintainer, we step in to manage team dynamics and operations.

### Account Automation

We automate account management tasks like archiving inactive users and repositories, maintaining a clean and efficient
workspace.

## Standards

### Repository Compliance

We check that all repositories align with
the [MoJ GitHub Repository Standards](https://user-guide.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/information/mojrepostandards.html#github-repository-standards-in-the-ministry-of-justice).

### Repository Templates Management

We provide and manage templates for repositories, promoting best practices and consistency across projects.

### Support

- Enterprise Support: We liaise with GitHub to resolve any issues and to get support for our enterprise instance.
