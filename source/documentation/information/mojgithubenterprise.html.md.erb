# GitHub

## Enterprise Account

The Operations Engineering team manages
the [Ministry of Justice GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprises/ministry-of-justice-uk). We maintain and
support our enterprise instance, which includes several organisations:

- [Ministry of Justice](https://github.com/ministryofjustice)
- [MoJ Analytical Services](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services)
- [Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority](https://github.com/CriminalInjuriesCompensationAuthority) *
  *_though it sits within the Enterprise Account, this organisation is not managed by Operations Engineering_*

### Actions Quota for Private and Internal Repositories

> The Ministry of Justices' GitHub Enterprise account reserves the following usage quotas for GitHub Actions (per
month):
>
> - **50,000** Minutes
> - **50GB** Storage

The quota renews at the start of each month and is a shared quota across all private and internal repositories in
MoJs GitHub Enterprise account.

Teams are responsible for actively managing their usage of actions for private and internal repositories. Reaching these
limits means that the service will be unavailable for private and internal repositories until the next reset.

_**These limits do not apply to public repositories.**_

If you are considering making your repository public, consider reading the technical guidance
on [converting private or internal repositories to public](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/storing-source-code.html#private-repositories)
and
our [Dos and Don't Guide for Public Repositories](https://user-guide.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/information/storing-code-in-public.html).

## Access Management

Operations Engineering is responsible for granting access to both the Ministry of Justice and the MoJ Analytical
Services Organisations.

### Single Sign On (SSO) for Ministry of Justice Organisation

[SSO](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/sso) to gain access via your Google Workspace account.

### Third-Party Supplier Management

If you are a Third-Party Supplier who is maintaining code on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, you will need to be
added as
an [Outside Collaborator](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/storing-source-code.html#outside-collaborator).

Outside Collaborators will only be able to gain access to specific repositories.

If you require access/need to give access to an Outside Collaborator, raise an issue or pull request in the relevant
repository for the organisation below:

- Ministry of
  Justice = [ministryofjustice/github-collaborators](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-collaborators)
- MoJ Analytical
  Services = [moj-analytical-services/github-outside-collaborators](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/github-outside-collaborators)
