# GitHub Community Slack Channel

The Operations Engineering team also manages a Slack channel dedicated to all things GitHub under the name [#github-community](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C05L0KBA7RS).

The aim of the channel is to provide the following:

- A safe space for users to discuss anything and everything related to GitHub.

- An avenue for Operations Engineering to provide news and updates from GitHub, including changes made by us.

- A way to get feedback from our users to understand common pain points relating to GitHub.

- A place for users to learn new skills and share interesting discoveries.

We only ask that requests related to access are kept to the [#ask-operations-engineering channel](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01BUKJSZD4) in order for us to better track these types of requests.
