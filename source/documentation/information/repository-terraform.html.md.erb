# Github Repository Terraform

In Operations Engineering, we manage our Github Repositories through Terraform. The [Github repository Terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/ministryofjustice/repository/github/latest) is used to define our repositories in a stack in the operations-engineering repository.

## How to create a new repository in the ministryofjustice organization

Begin by navigating to the [operations-engineering](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering) repository and select the 'Issue' tab. Click on the 'New issue' button. Choose the `GitHub Feature Request` issue template. This template contains relevant fields for your request and will help us track it effectively.

```markdown
As a [Your Role],
I want [the feature or change],
So that [benefit/value].
```
