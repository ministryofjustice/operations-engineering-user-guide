# Who Are Operations Engineering?

Operations Engineering buy, build, and run tools to help build and operate software at scale.

While we will use the Cloud Platform for developing and hosting our services, as a team the
tools and standards we create will be made readily available across multiple platforms and
hosting services across the organisation.
