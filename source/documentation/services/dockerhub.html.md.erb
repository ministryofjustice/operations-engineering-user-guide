# MoJ DockerHub Account

Operations Engineering owns the [Ministry of Justice DockerHub account](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/ministryofjustice), and associated user licences for Docker Desktop.

**Docker Desktop** is a desktop client for running Docker containers etc - NB you must have a licensed Docker account

**DockerHub** is a Docker image repository

## Licensed Docker accounts

To use Docker Desktop as part of your MOJ work, you need to be licensed. This means you must have a Docker account in the ministryofjustice Docker organisation - see: (Registering with the MOJ DockerHub)[registering-with-the-moj-dockerhub]

## Registering with the MOJ DockerHub

We have configured the ministrofjustice organisation to automatically add as members those who use GitHub SSO and have a digital.justice.gov.uk email address.

To register, browse to <https://hub.docker.com/> and sign up with your digital.justice.gov.uk email. You will be taken through an Auth0 flow where you will be asked to authenticate with GitHub. Once that is complete you will automatically be a member of the [ministryofjustice Docker organisation](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/ministryofjustice).

Add a name that is based on your actual name. This will ensure that your account can be identified as part of the Joiners, Movers and Leavers Process (JML).

If you have a DockerHub account that you would like to continue using, make sure your digital.justice.gov.uk email is listed on that account. When you go through the SSO process, the accounts will be merged.

> Your GitHub account must have the digital.justice.gov.uk email address as its primary email address.

## Sign in

Sign in from <https://hub.docker.com/> or the Docker Desktop app, then select 'GitHub' to use SSO.

## Support

If you are having trouble completing sign-in with SSO in Docker Desktop, note that it requires version 4.4.2 at minimum for the process to work.

If you have any issues please contact #ask-operations-engineering slack channel.
