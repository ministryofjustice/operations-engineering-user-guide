# DockerHub Account Management

The Operations Engineering team manages the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) DockerHub account, which includes the administration of user licenses for Docker Desktop.

## Overview of Tools

- **Docker Desktop**: This is a desktop application for managing and running Docker containers.

Note: A licensed Docker account is required to use Docker Desktop for MoJ-related tasks.

- **DockerHub**: DockerHub serves as a repository for Docker images.

## License Requirements for Docker Accounts

For any MoJ work involving Docker Desktop, a licensed Docker account is mandatory. Employees must be affiliated with the MoJ DockerHub organisation.

## How to Register with MoJ DockerHub

The "ministryofjustice" DockerHub organisation is set to automatically include members who sign in using GitHub single-sign-on (SSO) with a digital.justice.gov.uk email. Follow these steps to register:

1. Visit [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) and sign up using your digital.justice.gov.uk email.
2. Follow SSO authentication process linked to your GitHub account.
3. Upon completion, you'll be added to the [ministryofjustice Docker organization](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/ministryofjustice).

Please use a name close to your actual name for easier identification during the Joiners, Movers, and Leavers Process (JML).

If you have an existing DockerHub account you wish to use, ensure it's linked to your digital.justice.gov.uk email. The SSO process will integrate your existing account with the MoJ organization.

Reminder: Your GitHub account must use your digital.justice.gov.uk email as the primary email.

## Logging In

To log in, access DockerHub via [this link](https://hub.docker.com/) or through the Docker Desktop app. Choose 'GitHub' for SSO authentication.

## Support and Troubleshooting

- Docker Desktop requires version 4.4.2 or later for SSO compatibility.
- For any issues, reach out to #ask-operations-engineering on Slack.
