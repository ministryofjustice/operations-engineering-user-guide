# Docker

## Docker Business Subscription

The Ministry of Justice have a Business Subcription with Docker which is centrally managed and paid for via the 
Operations Engineering Team within Platfoms and Architecure.

The purpose of this is to firstly enable teams to easily publish, share and store images to faciliate modern CI/CD pipelines
using containered applications with DockeHub. Secondly to enhance local development workflows when working with containerised
applications with Docker Desktop.

### Quota

> The Ministry of Justices' Docker Business Subscription reserves the following usage quotas:
>
> - 400 Seats/Licences
>

Teams are resonsible for managing any application level quotas such as Image Pull Rate Limit for Authenticated Users. More details 
of quotas for Docker Business can be found on the [Docker Pricing Page](https://www.docker.com/pricing/).
