# CircleCI

CircleCI is a CI/CD pipeline build tool and is similiar in function to GitHub actions.

* [CircleCI Homepage](https://circleci.com/)

Operations Engineering have Admin level access to CirclCI so that we can provide support with setting up Orbs and Contexts.

For questions and advice please ask in the [#circleci-users](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CCSD5F397) Slack channel. 

## Accessing CircleCI

Access to CircleCI is granted via SSO, so no special setup is required.

## Creating Orbs

You can find information about Orbs [here](https://circleci.com/docs/concepts/#orbs)

Orbs can only be created and published by GitHub Organisation [owners](https://github.com/organizations/ministryofjustice/settings/apps)

## Creating Contexts

You can find information about Contexts [here](https://circleci.com/docs/concepts/#contexts)

There is a hard limit of 500 contexts and this cannot be increased, so please re-use Contexts and delete unused ones where possible.

## Support

If you need any assistance please contact Operations Engineering via [#ask-operations-engineering](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01BUKJSZD4)
