# CircleCI

CircleCI is a CI/CD pipeline build tool and is similiar in function to GitHub actions.

* [CircleCI Homepage](https://circleci.com/)

Operations Engineering have Admin level access to CirclCI so that we can provide support with setting up Orbs and Contexts.

We have a [#circleci-users](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CCSD5F397) community Slack channel to discuss topics of interest with other MoJ users of CircleCI.

## Accessing CircleCI

Access to CircleCI is granted via SSO, using your GitHub identity. If you don't have access to one of our GitHub orginsations please [request access](https://user-guide.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/information/mojgithubenterprise.html#access-management) in the first instance.

**Step 1** - From the main [CicleCI Login page](https://circleci.com/vcs-authorize/) click on the **Log in** button.

**Step 2** - **Do not** login via email. Instead, click the text **"Signed up for CircleCI with GitHub or Bitbucket before September 2023?"**.

**Step 3** - Click on the **Log in with GitHub** button.

Access to projects and pipelines within CircleCI will be defined by the access permissions to projects in GitHub. If you can't access the appropriate project please contact the maintainer or admin of your GitHub Repository. If there is no admin or maintainer please contact the team in our Slack channel, [#ask-operations-engineering](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C01BUKJSZD4), or via email at [operations-engineering@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:operations-engineering@digital.justice.gov.uk).  

## Creating Orbs

You can find information about Orbs [here](https://circleci.com/docs/concepts/#orbs)

Orbs can only be created and published by GitHub Organisation [owners](https://github.com/organizations/ministryofjustice/settings/apps)

## Creating Contexts

You can find information about Contexts [here](https://circleci.com/docs/concepts/#contexts)

There is a hard limit of 500 contexts and this cannot be increased, so please re-use Contexts and delete unused ones where possible.

## Support

If you need some support from CircleCI we have a shared support slack channel [#visitor-moj-circleci](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C06V1CGUNJ3).
