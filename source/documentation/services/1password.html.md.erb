# What is 1Password?

1Password is the MoJ approved password management tool that can be used to create, store and share passwords.

1Password securely saves passwords in a Vault and can be used to autofill saved passwords via a browser extension - available for most popular browsers.  It's also available as full software suite for both Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS.

Please refer to the [MoJ Security Guidance - 1Password](https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/using-1password/#using-1password) page for information regarding the use of 1Password.
