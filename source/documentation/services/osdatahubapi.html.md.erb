# OS Data Hub

## Overview

The Ministry of Justice uses [OS Data Hub](https://osdatahub.os.uk/) for a number of address and map API tools.

Here are the APIs that are available:

* [OS Places API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/places/overview)
* [OS Linked Identifiers API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/linkedIdentifiers/overview)
* [OS Names API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/names/overview)
* [OS Vector Tile API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/vts/overview)
* [OS Features API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/wfs/overview)
* [OS Maps API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/wmts/overview)
* [OS NGD API – Features](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/ofa/overview)
* [OS NGD API – Tiles](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/ota/overview)
* [OS Downloads API](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/downloads/overview)

We provide access to the OS Datahub so that Teams can create and manage their API keys.

## Requesting access to OS Datahub

Self [sign-up up to the Public Sector Plan](https://osdatahub.os.uk/plans). Cick on the "Sign-up Now" button and enter a work email address.

## Creating a Team Space to manage your API keys

After you have signed up to OS Datahub you should submit a request for a Team Space, or ask to be added to an existing Team Space. Contact #ask-operations-engineering slack channel or [operations-engineering@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:operations-engineering@digital.justice.gov.uk) with team name details. We recommend that Team Space names are in the format `<business-unit> <application>` e.g. `LAA CCMS`.

## Creating API Keys

You will be able to create you own API keys follow [OS Datahub documentation](https://osdatahub.os.uk/).

We recommend the following when creating keys:
- API keys have the naming convention `<business-unit> <application> <environment>` e.g. `LAA CCMS Development`
- API key per environment i.e. dev, staging and prod

When you have created your API key add it to your Team Space to ensure that access is limited to your Team. Any keys that are not managed within a Team Space can be seen by other users in the account.

## Cost of OS Places API

There is no cost to service teams for use of the service. The MoJ is part of the [Public Sector Geospacial Agreement](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/public-sector-geospatial-agreement) which makes the service free to Public Sector organisations.

## Revoking Keys

If an API key is no longer required you can delete a key via your Team Space.

## What if my key gets exposed?

OS Data Hub API keys should be treated like any secret/credential. If exposed you can recycle your key via your Team Space.

Whilst the API provides data that is already in the public domain, there is the potential for financial risk to the Ministry of Justice should a key be misused.

## Further Support

Full documentation for the APIs can be found [here](https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs).

If further support from Ordnance Survey is needed please contact #ask-operations-engineering slack channel or [operations-engineering@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:operations-engineering@digital.justice.gov.uk), with details for required support, in the first instance so that a ticket can be raised.
